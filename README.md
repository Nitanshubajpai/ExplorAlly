# Explorally

A platform to connect tourists, tour guides, and local vendors dependent on tourism altogether.
While traveling to or within India, 
- Tourists can register at our website and login to book local guides with similar interests at lower-than-normal rates.
- Tourists can explore the destination city virtually through our discover feature on the website.
- Tourists can view a virtual tour of popular places within the city and the things that are popular within the destination.
- Tourists can also explore the local vendors and the products they sell at the destination city through the discover page.
- Tourists can book the desired guide by looking at his/her profile and can also specify special requirements (if any) they need for the tour.
Local people interested in showing their hometown to tourists can register on our website as tour guides by specifying their desired charges for each hour. This profile will be visible to tourists who can hire them by looking at their profile.
Small businesses dependent on tourism can register on our website as local vendors. After registering, they can list all their products and offer services for the development of their business.
